# AI Crypto Trading and Training by TT

A crypto paper-trading trainer with live market data and AI-powered ratings.
Pick your assets and starting capital on an animated start screen, then trade a
virtual portfolio against real prices — zero risk, real skills.

- **15 assets** — BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, XRP, LINK, SUI, AVAX, TRX, ADA, ARB,
  ONDO, TAO, HYPE, DOGE — with live prices refreshed **every 60 seconds**
- **Four-axis AI rating** per asset (0–100): Momentum, Risk, Structure,
  Relative Strength — combined into a composite score, letter grade, and signal
- **Paper trading** with an average-cost-basis portfolio, realistic 0.10% fees,
  P&L tracking, and full trade history
- **Interactive charts everywhere** — portfolio value, every stat, every asset —
  each switchable between 1H / 24H / 1W / 1M / 1Y / All
- **Four languages** — English, Հայերեն, Русский, Español
- Light and dark themes, single self-contained web UI, no build step

## Quick start

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn server:app --port 8000
```

Open <http://localhost:8000>. The start screen walks you through language,
asset selection, and starting capital; the engine begins collecting live data
immediately. One process runs both the data engine and the web interface.

To keep it running in the background:

```bash
nohup .venv/bin/python -m uvicorn server:app --port 8000 > bot.log 2>&1 &
```

## Put it on the public internet

The repository is public — anyone can run their own instance with the three
commands above. To host a public URL, the included [`render.yaml`](render.yaml)
deploys it to Render's free tier in a few clicks:

1. Open **<https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/tovmaskayuf/ai_trading_training_bot>**
2. Sign in (free), confirm, and Render builds and starts the service
3. Your instance is live at `https://<your-service>.onrender.com`

### Add a CoinGecko key when deploying

Running locally needs no keys at all. On Render it is worth one extra minute:
CoinGecko rate-limits keyless requests **per client IP**, and Render's free
tier egresses through shared addresses that are throttled on reputation, so the
call fails there however slowly you poll. Prices are unaffected — Binance and
Hyperliquid carry those — but market cap and rank come back empty and the
Structure axis then scores on volume trend and spread alone.

1. Get a free **Demo** key at <https://www.coingecko.com/en/developers/dashboard>
2. In Render: **Environment → Add Environment Variable**
3. Key `COINGECKO_API_KEY`, value your key. Leave `COINGECKO_PLAN` as `demo`.

CoinGecko answers `200` to an *invalid* key rather than rejecting it, so a typo
looks exactly like a rate limit. The startup log prints which mode is active —
`coingecko auth: demo key ...abcd` or `coingecko auth: keyless` — check it there.

Free-tier honesty notes:

- The instance **sleeps after ~15 minutes idle** and wakes on the next visit
  (the first load takes ~30 seconds while it spins up).
- Free instances have **no persistent disk** — the portfolio and collected
  history reset whenever the instance restarts. Fine for practice; add a paid
  disk if you want history to survive.
- The app currently keeps **one portfolio per instance** (no accounts), so a
  shared public URL shares one portfolio among its visitors. Per-visitor
  portfolios are a planned next step.

## Data sources — no API keys required to run locally

| Source | Role |
|---|---|
| Binance public REST | Prices, 24h stats, hourly + daily candles, order book — 14 of 15 assets |
| Hyperliquid public API | **HYPE only** — it is not listed on Binance spot (`HYPEUSDT` → `-1121`) |
| CoinGecko free | Market capitalization, basket rank, volume; price fallback |

All three work keyless from a home connection. The one optional key is
`COINGECKO_API_KEY`, which only matters on shared cloud hosting — see
[Add a CoinGecko key when deploying](#add-a-coingecko-key-when-deploying).

## The rating system

Each asset receives four sub-scores from 0–100, blended into a weighted
composite, a letter grade (A+ → F), and a signal.

| Axis | Default weight | What it measures |
|---|---|---|
| **Momentum** | 30% | RSI (1h + 4h), MACD histogram and slope, EMA 20/50/200 stacking, range position |
| **Risk** | 25% | ATR%, realized volatility, max drawdown, Sharpe — *inverted*: lower risk scores higher |
| **Structure** | 25% | Basket rank, turnover, volume trend, bid/ask spread |
| **Relative Strength** | 20% | Returns versus BTC and percentile within the basket across 24h/7d/30d |

Several axes are scored **relative to the 15-asset basket** rather than against
fixed thresholds — absolute bands are regime-dependent, and in a quiet market
they collapse every score toward zero.

Sub-scores are stored raw, so the **Rating Weights** sliders recompute the
composite instantly in your browser. The client-side formula is cross-checked
against `analytics/rating.py` and matches exactly.

Signals use hysteresis: **Buy** requires the composite to cross above 70, and
the signal does not flip to **Sell** until it falls to 45. The dead band
between prevents a score hovering near one threshold from flapping every
minute. *Holding* marks an asset you own; *Neutral* means genuinely flat.

## Trading

- Starting capital is whatever you chose on the start screen ($100 – $10M);
  changing it later resets the portfolio.
- **Average cost basis**, like a real brokerage: buying more of a holding
  averages into one line; partial sells book realized P&L against that average.
- **0.10% fee per side** — a flat round-trip loses exactly the fees, so results
  do not flatter you.
- Trade prices are always taken server-side from the latest cycle; a stale
  browser tab cannot fill at an old quote.

## Tests

```bash
.venv/bin/python tests/test_indicators.py   # indicator correctness (RSI, MACD, EMA, ATR…)
.venv/bin/python tests/test_manual.py       # portfolio accounting and settings guards
```

Plain scripts, not pytest — they print PASS/FAIL per assertion and exit
non-zero on failure. Run from the project root.

## Notes

- Indicators are **deliberately dependency-free** — plain Python lists, no
  numpy/pandas — so installs keep working on brand-new Python releases.
- Indicator functions return `None` on insufficient data; on a cold start some
  axes read "—" until enough candles accumulate. Expected, not a bug.
- The engine only collects data and rates assets. **It never trades** — every
  trade in the portfolio is one you made.
- The directory name contains `}{`, which breaks unquoted shell paths — always
  quote it. (The GitHub repo is `ai_trading_training_bot`; GitHub rejects braces.)
