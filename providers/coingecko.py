"""CoinGecko -- market-structure data for all 15 assets, plus the price
fallback when Binance is unavailable.

One /simple/price call covers every asset at once.

Works keyless, but keyless requests are rate-limited by client IP, and shared
cloud egress (Render's free tier especially) is throttled hard enough on
reputation alone that the call fails regardless of how slowly we poll. Setting
COINGECKO_API_KEY moves the quota onto the key instead of the IP, which is the
only thing that actually fixes it there. Demo and Pro keys use different hosts
and different header names, so the tier is selected explicitly.
